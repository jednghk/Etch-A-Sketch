Hi guys, this project was done as part of The Odin Project curriculum, which aimed to improve on my skills in DOM manipulation.

I felt this was a great project as it exposed me and forced me to apply many important DOM methods and attributes, such as 
querySelector, createElement, setting attributes and changing styles with JS.

The progress of the project was a lot smoother than the Google Homepage project, with most of the testing going quite smoothly
and not having to search my entire code for small bugs. Console logging is literally the most useful method to get experiment with
unfamiliar methods and generally debugging code. Chrome Devtools was tremendously useful as well in conjunction with console.log
to find the outputs of certain functions.

The project took a total of 3 days and honestly I took my time for this. On day 1 I produced a static 16x16 grid, which using CSS grid and adding the grids iteratively made it easier than I expected. On day 2 much of the time was spent adding the dynamic grid input which allowed the user to choose the dimensions they wanted the grids. On the last day I added the clear button as well as allowing the user to toggle between different pen types. 

Some things I'd like to improve/features to add:
1. Some of my variable names which I feel aren't very straightforward such as the ChangeDimension() function, which doubled up as the clear function.
2. Not having to reset the entire grid when the pen type changes.
3. Only starting to draw upon click and hold/click to toggle pen. Not very practical for people using the software if the pen is permanently drawing.
